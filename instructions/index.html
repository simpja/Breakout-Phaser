      <h2 class="sub-header"> What is it? </h2>

      <h3> Using a local webserver you can easily create an instance of the classic Breakout game and use other devices as controllers!</h3>

      <h2 class="sub-header">How do you do it?</h2>
      <ol>
        <li> Clone or download the repository </li>
        <li> Install Node.js if you don't already have it </li>
        <li> Navigate to the root folder using a terminal </li>
        <li> Run `ipconfig` and copy your IPv4 address under wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi. This is your local server IP<li>address. Let's name this parameter localServerIP </li>
        <li> Run `node server` to start the server on localhost </li>
        <li> Using the unit you want to present the screen from, navigate to _localServerIP:3000/home/_ in your browser and choose **Be the Game Screen** </li>
        <li> Using the unit for the first controller navigate to the same page but choose **Be Player One** </li>
        <li> Repeat for the second user, but choose to be player two instead. </li>
        <li> Play! </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="sub-header">How does it work?</h2>
      <p>A **node.js** script (server.js) uses the **express** library to create a local web server from your machine.</br>
      Websites created on this server will be available for devices on the same Wi-Fi using the ip address of your unit on the network and the port defined in the server script.</br>
      Using **socket.io**, web socket connections are created between clients using the website hosted from the server, and the server itself.</br>
      These sockets are created so that designated controller sub-pages on the website will emit events through the socket connection if the value of a slider is changed.</br>
      The server takes these values and updates the player objects on the game screen through another socket.
